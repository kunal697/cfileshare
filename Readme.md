# cshare

A simple CLI tool for file sharing. This is just a fun project where uploaded files are stored on my private GitHub repository.  
Neither I nor anyone else can identify users, as no user data is stored.

## ðŸš€ Get Started

1. **Install the package**  
   ```sh
   npm install -g cfileshare
